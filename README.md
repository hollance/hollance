### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an audio programming enthusiast who is currently **looking for work** in the field of audio software. (Remote, preferably on a freelance basis.)

Previously I've been employed as a machine learning engineer, a freelance iOS developer, and much more. I have also written and co-written a number of books and have published my own apps and games.
