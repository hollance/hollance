### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an audio programming enthusiast who is currently **looking for work** in the field of audio software. (Remote, preferably on a freelance basis.)

Most recently I've been employed as a machine learning engineer and as an iOS developer. These days I mostly write C++ audio code. I've been professionally active as a software developer since the mid 1990s.

I have also written and co-written a number of books (most notably *The iOS Apprentice* and *Core ML Survival Guide*) and have published my own apps and games as an indie developer.

- [Code Your Own Synth Plug-Ins With C++ and JUCE](https://leanpub.com/synth-plugin) â€” my latest book
