### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an audio software developer, working on my own plug-ins as well as freelance for other audio companies.

Most recently I've been employed as a machine learning engineer and as an iOS developer. These days I mostly write C++ audio code. I've been professionally active as a software developer since the mid 1990s.

I have also written and co-written a number of books (most notably *The iOS Apprentice* and *Core ML Survival Guide*) and have published my own apps and games as an indie developer.

My latest books:

- [The Complete Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Audio Plug-in Development](https://www.theaudioprogrammer.com/books/beginners-plugin-book)
- [Creating Synthesizer Plug-Ins with C++ and JUCE](https://www.theaudioprogrammer.com/books/synth-plugin-book)
